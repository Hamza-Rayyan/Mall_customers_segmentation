# Mall_customers_segmentation

Mall customers segmentation using clustering.

* Clustering:
    - K-means Clustering.
    - Hierarchical clustering.

Lets us first brush our concepts of clustering 
- clustering : unlike regression and classification, it groups the unlabbeled dataset into a group based on similarity between the features.

* Breif:
  We have a dataset of two hunderd customers and with many features such as Customer ID, gender, age, annual income, spending score.
  - As from our business prespective we focus on understanding our customer behaviour of buying or spending at mall so that later we can target them with their particular ideal market.
  - we will cluster them on the scale of annual income and spending score as rest of the attritubes are of no use.
  - We will use both clustering algorithm K-means and Hierarchical clustering to finds which fits better and gives higher accuracy.
