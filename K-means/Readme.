* Elbow Method.
By seeing our data we can cluster them into 5 clusters, but in-case if we dont know how many cluster are suited for our dataset we can go for Elbow method.
WCSS= ∑Pi in Cluster1 distance(Pi C1)2 +∑Pi in Cluster2distance(Pi C2)2+∑Pi in CLuster3 distance(Pi C3)2
basically looks at the distance between each points and centroids and adjust and square it.
the more cluster we have the smaller WCSS gets.

* K-means.
we have used K-means++ alg for initializing the centroids(cluster center) in the K-means clustering alg
after that normal k-means process continues.

in our case we have gotten 5 clusters.
